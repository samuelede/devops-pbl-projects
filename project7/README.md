## DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION




### Setup and technologies used in Project 7
As a member of a DevOps team, you will implement a tooling website solution which makes access to DevOps tools within the corporate infrastructure easily accessible.

In this project you will implement a solution that consists of following components:

1. Infrastructure: AWS
2. Webserver Linux: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
3. Database Server: Ubuntu 20.04 + MySQL
4. Storage Server: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 + NFS Server
5. Programming Language: PHP
6. Code Repository: GitHub

On the diagram below you can see a common pattern where several stateless Web Servers share a common database and also access the same files using Network File Sytem (NFS) as a shared file storage. Even though the NFS server might be located on a completely separate hardware â€“ for Web Servers it look like a local file system from where they can serve the same files.
